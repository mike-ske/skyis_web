 What I've Built So Far - Project Update

Hey team, let me walk you through what I've accomplished with the marketplace. It's been quite a journey and I've made some solid progress.

 The Big Picture

So basically, we now have a fully functional e-commerce marketplace where customers can browse products, add them to their cart, and checkout. The whole system is connected and working smoothly across all our pages.

 The Shopping Cart - Our Main Achievement

This was the big one. We got the shopping cart working everywhere. When someone adds an item to their cart, it stays there even when they move around the site. The cart shows up in a nice modal popup, and users can see everything they've added, change quantities, remove items they don't want anymore, and see their total with tax included. The tax gets calculated automatically at 7.5 percent.

What's really cool is that the cart knows if someone is logged in. If they are, it welcomes them back by name. If not, it gently suggests they should sign in to save their cart for later.

 How the Site is Organized

I've set up the marketplace into main sections. There's Luxury for high-end stuff, Ready-to-Wear for everyday clothing, Bespoke for custom designs, and Thrift & Pre-Loved for sustainable fashion finds.

Each of these main sections branches out into three smaller categories. So Luxury has things like designer costumes, luxury bags, and our wear and style collections. This gives customers a nice way to drill down into exactly what they're looking for.

We also have a complete wedding section with bridal dresses, bridal shoes, groomsmen suits, and bridal accessories. That's four separate pages just for weddings.

All together, we're looking at 17 different product listing pages. That's a lot of browsing options for customers.

 The Product Pages

Each category page shows 12 products laid out in a grid that adjusts nicely whether you're on a phone, tablet, or computer. Every product card shows the essentials - a photo, the price, customer ratings with stars, whether it's available to buy, rent, or auction, and a short description.

We added some nice touches like hover effects so cards lift up a bit when you mouse over them. There are also filter buttons at the top for color, price, and size, though we still need to wire those up to actually filter things.

Oh, and there's a heart icon on each product so people can save their favorites. That works independently without messing up anything else.

 The Navigation Flow

Here's where we solved a tricky problem. When someone clicks on a product card, they go straight to the detailed product page. But here's the thing - we have three different types of detail pages depending on whether the item is for buying, renting, or auction.

The system automatically figures out which page to send them to based on the product type. So if you click on a rental gown, you go to the rental detail page. If you click on something at auction, you go to the auction page. It all happens seamlessly.

We had to fix a bug where clicking on products was showing a black screen. That's all sorted now. The issue was with how we were passing the product information between pages.

 The Technical Stuff

We built a template system so we're not writing the same code over and over. There's one master template for category pages, and we just feed it different products and text for each section. This keeps everything looking consistent and makes it way easier to maintain.

All the interactive buttons work properly now. When you click "Add to Cart," it adds the item without accidentally navigating away from the page. Same with the wishlist heart icon. We had to add some specific code to prevent those buttons from triggering page changes.

The whole cart system uses something called React Context, which is basically a way to share the cart information across the entire site without having to manually pass it through every single page. Much cleaner that way.

 What Customers Experience

The design is clean and professional. We're using Tailwind for styling, so everything has that modern look. It works well on phones, which is important since a lot of shopping happens on mobile these days.

Products have color-coded badges. Yellow means you can rent it, white means buy it, and teal means it's up for auction. Makes it easy to tell at a glance.

Star ratings show up clearly, and the shopping cart icon in the navigation shows a little number indicating how many items are in there. Small touches like that make the whole experience feel polished.

 What's Working Right Now

All 17 product pages are up and running. You can go from the homepage to any category, click into subcategories, pick a product, view its details, add it to cart, and head to checkout. The whole flow works end to end.

We tested it pretty thoroughly. Navigation works, cart works, the buttons do what they're supposed to do, and it looks good on different devices.

 What We Still Need to Build

Now, let me be honest about what's not done yet. There are definitely some features we need to add to make this complete.

 The Similar Items Section

You know how when you're looking at a product on most shopping sites, there's a section that says "You May Also Like" or "Similar Items"? We need to build that. It's a pretty important feature because it keeps people browsing and discovering more products. Right now, when someone lands on a product detail page, that's kind of the end of the road unless they use the back button.

 Working Filter Dropdowns

Those filter buttons I mentioned earlier for color, price, and size? They're there visually, but they don't actually do anything yet. We need to wire them up so when someone clicks "Size: Large" or "Price: Under 50k," the products actually filter down to match. Right now they're just placeholders.

 Search Functionality

There's no search bar working yet. Customers need to be able to type in what they're looking for and get relevant results. That's a big one for user experience.

 Product Reviews and Ratings

We're showing star ratings on products, but there's no way for customers to actually leave reviews or see what other people have said. That whole review system needs to be built out.

 Wishlist Page

The heart icon lets people favorite things, and we're tracking that, but there's no dedicated wishlist page where they can see all their saved items in one place. That would be really helpful for customers who are comparing options.

 Order History

Once someone buys something, they should be able to see their past orders. We need to build an order history page in the user account area.

 Payment Integration

The checkout page exists, but we haven't integrated with any payment processors yet. No Paystack, no Stripe, nothing. That's obviously essential before we can actually sell anything.

 Auction Functionality

We have auction-type products marked, but there's no actual auction mechanism. No bidding system, no countdown timers, no highest bidder tracking. That's a whole feature set on its own.

 Rental Calendar and Returns

For rental items, we need a calendar system so people can pick rental dates, and we need to handle the return process. Right now rentals are just treated like regular purchases.

 Product Zoom and Image Gallery

On the product detail pages, customers should be able to click on images to zoom in and see details. If there are multiple product photos, they should be able to flip through them. That's not built yet.

 Size Charts and Fit Guides

Especially for clothing, people need size charts. We should have a popup or overlay that shows measurements so people can figure out what size to order.

 Stock Management

We're showing products as "in stock" but there's no real inventory tracking. We need a system that updates stock levels when items are purchased and shows "out of stock" when appropriate.

 Quick View Feature

Many e-commerce sites let you click a "Quick View" button to see product details in a popup without leaving the current page. That's a nice feature we don't have yet.

 Product Comparison

Let customers select multiple items and compare them side by side. Useful when deciding between similar products.

 Recently Viewed Items

Track what products someone has looked at and show them a "Recently Viewed" section. Helps people find their way back to things they were considering.

 The Bottom Line

I've built the foundation and the core shopping experience. The structure is solid, the cart works, navigation is smooth, and customers can browse through a well-organized catalog. 

But there's still work to do to make it a complete, competitive e-commerce platform. The features we're missing aren't decorative - they're things customers expect and that drive sales. Similar products, working filters, search, reviews, and proper payment processing are all on the to-do list.

The good news is that the hard part - the architecture and core functionality - is done. Adding these additional features is more straightforward now that we have a solid foundation to build on.

Let me know if you have questions about any of this or if you want to discuss priorities for what we tackle next.
